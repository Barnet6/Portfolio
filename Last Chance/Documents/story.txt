4.3.1  Introduction
In a world rife with madness, the air toxic to breathe, the very earth poisoned to its core, it has been 200 years since the world ended. 200 years since the seas boiled and the earth erupted, spewing forth gases that burned the lungs, and liquids that melted the flesh. 200 years since the creaatures crawled out of the dark, and attacked those that lived in the light.

Plantlife died quickly. After 20 years, only the largest trees were still standing. Everything else has either died or grown sickly, twisted and stunted. After 50 years, even the great trees gave in, collapsing, one by one. Now, after 200 years, green was just a memory, spoken of in stories of days gone by.
